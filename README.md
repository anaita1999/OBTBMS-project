An online bus ticket booking system is a web-based application that allows users to book bus tickets online. The system is designed to make the ticket booking process easier and more convenient for both the bus operators and passengers.
The system typically consists of three main modules:

User module: This module allows users to search for available bus routes, select their desired route, view the bus schedule, and book tickets. Users can also view their booking history and cancel bookings if needed.

Admin module: This module is designed for bus operators to manage their bus routes, schedules, and fares. The admin module also allows bus operators to view the booking details, track bus status, and manage user feedback.

Payment module: This module allows users to make payments securely using various payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, net banking, or e-wallets.

The online bus ticket booking system requires the use of several technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The front-end of the system is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end is developed using PHP and MySQL. The payment gateway integration requires additional security measures to ensure the safety of users' payment information.
